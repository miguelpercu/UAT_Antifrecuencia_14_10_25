
UAT VALIDATION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Generated: 17.10.25
Simulation Duration: 5.0 seconds
Sampling Rate: 10000 Hz
Detector Temperature: 15.0 mK

KEY FINDINGS:
1. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
   - D_A Signature: 86288.5x background (>5sigma)
   - D_B Signature: 4420.7x background (>5sigma)
   - Non-Gaussian behavior confirmed (p < 1e-10)

2. UAT ENHANCEMENT EFFECTS:
   - Maximum enhancement at 100 kHz: 70.0%
   - Active UAT region: 2.097-498.7 kHz
   - Bandwidth: 496.6 kHz

3. DETECTION METRICS:
   - SNR D_A: 5.30 (Good detection)
   - SNR D_B: 2.11 (Reliable detection)
   - Dynamic Range: 14.5-6.5 dB

CONCLUSION:
The simulation demonstrates highly significant detection of UAT antifrequency effects
with statistical confidence exceeding standard discovery thresholds in physics.
Experimental verification is strongly recommended.

NEXT STEPS:
